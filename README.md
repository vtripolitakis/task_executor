# Scenario Simulator

This Python script simulates different scenarios for running commands with various delay patterns. It reads scenario configurations from a YAML file and executes them accordingly.

## Usage

To run the simulator, use the following command:

```
python simulate.py ./scenarios/scenarios.yaml
```

Where `scenarios.yaml` is the path to your YAML configuration file containing the scenarios you want to run.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyYAML library

## Installation
Create a new virtual environment and run:  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Scenario Types

The simulator supports four different scenario types (listed below):

1. **No Delay**
   - Type: `no_delay`
   - Description: Runs the specified command multiple times without any delay between executions.
   - Parameters:
     - `command`: The command to run
     - `times`: Number of times to run the command
   - Optional Parameters
     - `pre_command`: The command to run before scenario command runs
     - `post_command`: The command to run after scenario command runs

2. **Random Delay**
   - Type: `random_delay`
   - Description: Runs the command multiple times with a random delay between each execution.
   - Parameters:
     - `command`: The command to run
     - `times`: Number of times to run the command
     - `max_delay`: Maximum delay in seconds (delay will be random between 0 and this value)
   - Optional Parameters
     - `pre_command`: The command to run before scenario command runs
     - `post_command`: The command to run after scenario command runs

3. **Fixed Delay Block**
   - Type: `fixed_delay_block`
   - Description: Runs the command in blocks, with a fixed delay after each block.
   - Parameters:
     - `command`: The command to run
     - `times`: Total number of times to run the command
     - `k`: Number of executions in each block
     - `fixed_delay`: Fixed delay in seconds after each block
   - Optional Parameters
     - `pre_command`: The command to run before scenario command runs
     - `post_command`: The command to run after scenario command runs

4. **Random Delay Block**
   - Type: `random_delay_block`
   - Description: Runs the command in blocks, with a random delay after each block.
   - Parameters:
     - `command`: The command to run
     - `times`: Total number of times to run the command
     - `k`: Number of executions in each block
     - `max_delay`: Maximum delay in seconds after each block (delay will be random between 0 and this value)
   - Optional Parameters
     - `pre_command`: The command to run before scenario command runs
     - `post_command`: The command to run after scenario command runs

5. **Random Block Size with Fixed Delay**
    - Type: random_block_size_fixed_delay
    - Description: Runs the command in blocks of random size, with a fixed delay after each block.
    - Parameters:
      - `command`: The command to run
      - `times`: Total number of times to run the command
      - `max_block_size`: Maximum size of each block (block size will be random between 1 and this value)
      - `fixed_delay`: Fixed delay in seconds after each block
   - Optional Parameters
     - `pre_command`: The command to run before scenario command runs
     - `post_command`: The command to run after scenario command runs


6. **Random Block Size with Random Delay**
    - Type: random_block_size_random_delay
    - Description: Runs the command in blocks of random size, with a random delay after each block.
    - Parameters:
      - `command`: The command to run
      - `times`: Total number of times to run the command
      - `max_block_size`: Maximum size of each block (block size will be random between 1 and this value)
      - `max_delay`: Maximum delay in seconds after each block (delay will be random between 0 and this value)
   - Optional Parameters
     - `pre_command`: The command to run before scenario command runs
     - `post_command`: The command to run after scenario command runs
